            <p>
                Are men really so much less empathetic than women? Can they truly not understand the problem? How is it possible that when you say to them, "Imagine if this happened to your mother, sister, or daughter," they won't budge?
            </p>
            <p>
                To be honest, this breaks my heart. I just hope that they wouldn't deny science as well. I spent nights searching, reading articles, and summarizing them so I wouldn't forget—me, someone who doesn't even like reading, spent hours doing so. I did it because I've grown tired, disappointed, and that feeling is turning into anger and hate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing this book was my way out of my own thoughts. It doesn't contain even half of what I wanted to say, but I decided to stay true to my initial goal: a science-based book. I hope it will help break or shatter at least a small piece of this frustrating society.

            <h2>The Antidote to Anecdotes.</h2>
            <p>
                This Book is a 110-page, 7-chapter arsenal you can finish in one sitting (in less then 5 hours). It's packed with real studies on the biological and cognitive differences between men and women, the historical rise of patriarchy, and the scientific reasons behind the inequality we see today (Privilege blindess, capitalism...).
            </p>
            <p>
                It's simple, accessible, and i hope fun. Every few pages, there's a new study, a new insight, a new "aha!" moment. It even dives into women's incredible achievements and ends with a chapter on how to debate effectively—not with anger, but with evidence.

                So, you made it this far. Thank you. Now, for the confessions. The name on the cover is a pen name. And I don't actually like reading. It was a monumental effort to get through a pile of feminist literature and articles just to understand what this book should be.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea to write it came from a very practical need: I wanted to fund my master's degree abroad. But what started as a financial goal quickly became something precious. 
                I ended up loving the process. Enjoying it. Getting
                addicted to it. This book became precious to me, and I feel
                like I’ve shared an intimate part of myself. You might say I’m exaggerating, but it really does feel this way, and that’s the main reason I didn’t use my real name. I am proud of completing and publishing this—more proud, in fact, than I am of having a computer science bachelor’s degree (yes i wrote the code of this page hehe).
                So, it ended with a piece of my heart poured onto this pages.
